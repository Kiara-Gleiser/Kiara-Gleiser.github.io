In Spring 2025, I'm taking a Quantitative Reasoning class focused on R programming and data science. Here's a collection of my project work that demonstrates my growing expertise in data analysis and visualization.

## [Building a Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/kiara-gleiser/your-repo)

This project showcases my ability to:

-   Create and deploy a professional portfolio website using Quarto and GitHub Pages
-   Implement version control best practices with Git
-   Write clear, well-documented R code for data analysis
-   Structure and present technical content for different audiences
-   Develop a professional online presence for data science work

The complete source code is available in the linked GitHub repository, demonstrating my commitment to open-source development and reproducible research practices.
